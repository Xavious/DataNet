## Description

A web browser inspired Mudlet package for Legends of the Jedi (LOTJ)

### Usage

**Known Issue** - Links break when traversing forward or backwards through browser history

Download the latest .mpackage file from the release page and install it like any other Mudlet package.

https://github.com/Xavious/DataNet/releases/tag/v1.0.0

Once installed you use it by clicking datanet links that you see in the game. The browser will automatically popup.

**Mouse Interactions**

- Add tab button
- Close tab button
- Back button
- Forward button
- Refresh ( mostly for refreshing links on pages cycled forward or back to)

Links
- **single click** - open page in the current tab
- **right click** - dropdown menu to open in current tab or new tab

**Commands**
- `showdata` - show the popup window
- `hidedata` - hide the popup window
- `resetdata` - if the triggers break this will reset the captures (hopefully that doesn't happen
